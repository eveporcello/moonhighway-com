# Who we train

We teach Javascript to **technical professionals**. We migrate engineers from
traditional object-oriented languages to JavaScript. We upgrade current
JavaScript **developers** to the latest techniques and practices. We teach
**creatives** how to be more effective with JavaScript and CSS. We also provide
classes for **managers** and **non-technical stakeholders**, so they can understand
how everything fits together. We can teach your entire team how to build
JavaScript applications that run on a server, in a browser, on a phone, on a
robot, or in virtual reality.

# Who we are

Moon Highway is a family business. **Alex Banks** and **Eve Porcello** are instructors,
curriculum designers, authors, and partners both in business and in life.

# What Makes Us Unique

## Experience

Alex developed his first website in 1995 and started teaching full stack web
development during the first dot com boom and wrote JavaScript code before
there was AJAX. We've watched JavaScript as it has matured over the years.
Through all of it, we've been in the classroom.

## Knowledge

Instead of teaching every language, we focus specifically on JavaScript.
We build our apps using JavaScript. Reducing our scope of courses to
JavaScript allows us to dive deep into this technology and remain on the
cutting edge of the most popular programming language in the world.

## Focus

Moon Highway classes are not about us. They are about you. It's not what
we can do with JavaScript or what we know about web development. It's
about whether or not you can get the job done. Our classes are not all-day
lectures. They are all-day hack-a-thons. We train engineers as if they are
going to come work on our team.

## Materials

We think a lot about training and training materials. We've come up with a
modular approach to course content that allows us to customize each class
to the needs of a specific team. We treat our content like software. All of
our course files are hosted in GitHub, and we update them continuously.

We've even standardized how we approach to content development.
**All of our course content falls under one of the following categories:**

## Samples

Samples are small, simplified, reduced, chunks of code designed to illustrate a
concept. They are executable, students can modify and run the code. Sometimes
the best way to learn is to change something in a sample as see how that affects
the output.

## Topics

Samples are small, simplified, reduced, chunks of code designed to illustrate a
concept. They are executable, students can modify and run the code. Sometimes
the best way to learn is to change something in a sample as see how that affects
the output.

## Labs

Labs are challenges that are presented to the student as requirements, specifications,
and sometimes wireframes. Labs are typically small enough for a student to complete in
roughly 30 minutes. They are designed to get students solving problems themselves with
their own code.

## Exercises

Exercises are longer activities that are designed to simulate a real world implementation
of a topic. Exercises consist of iterations where students complete tasks step by step
together as a class typically to complete an application.

<Picture src={Exercises}>Exercise: Creating a Graph View</Picture>

Our courses are structured using a combination of these techniques. Samples introduce a
technique, labs challenge the student to implement that technique on their own, and
exercises give us a feel for how to implement that technique in the real world. This
process leverages the power of reinforcement and is designed to build student confidence.

# Online content

Since 2015, weâ€™ve created several classes as LinkedIn Learning authors. Although our classroom
materials go into greater detail, these online courses are a great way to get a feel for our
presentation style.
