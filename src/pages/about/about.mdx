Moon Highway is a training and curriculum development company based
in Northern California. Our goal in every course is to build confidence by
challenging students to succeed. We create an environment that nurtures
success in every classroom for students at every skill level. We believe
that success is contagious. The excitement that we build with one small
group of engineers will permeate your entire organization.

# Who we train

We teach Javascript to **technical professionals**. We migrate engineers from
traditional object-oriented languages to JavaScript. We upgrade current
JavaScript **developers** to the latest techniques and practices. We teach
**creatives** how to be more effective with JavaScript and CSS. We also provide
classes for **managers** and **non-technical stakeholders**, so they can understand
how everything fits together. We can teach your entire team how to build
JavaScript applications that run on a server, in a browser, on a phone, on a
robot, or in virtual reality.

# Who we are

Moon Highway is a family business. **Alex Banks** and **Eve Porcello** are instructors,
curriculum designers, authors, and partners both in business and in life.
