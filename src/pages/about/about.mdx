# Who we train

We teach Javascript to **technical professionals**. We migrate engineers from
traditional object-oriented languages to JavaScript. We upgrade current
JavaScript **developers** to the latest techniques and practices. We teach
**creatives** how to be more effective with JavaScript and CSS. We also provide
classes for **managers** and **non-technical stakeholders**, so they can understand
how everything fits together. We can teach your entire team how to build
JavaScript applications that run on a server, in a browser, on a phone, on a
robot, or in virtual reality.

# Who we are
