            No matter what your job role is, it's likely that you'll need to
            understand how GraphQL works and how you can get data from GraphQL
            APIs. In this online workshop series, you'll learn the basics of
            GraphQL in two parts: The Query Language and The Schema Definition
            Language.

            A strong GraphQL schema is the foundation of any GraphQL API
            project. It's a document that describes your API's types. It's a
            blueprint for building applications. It's a contract that offers a
            shared understanding to developers, managers, and QA, so they can
            build the right products the first time with focus and clarity.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this online course, you'll learn to build readable, scalable,
            well-documented schemas with GraphQL's schema definition language.
            We'll cover real-world examples and best practices that you can
            apply immediately to your own schema design projects. Learn to speak
            the language of GraphQL fluently, no matter your job role.
