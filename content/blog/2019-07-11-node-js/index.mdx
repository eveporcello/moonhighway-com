It has been 8 years since we made the decision to build everything using JavaScript and Node.js. It was a good decision. It has been a lot of fun watching JavaScript, Node, and React explode in popularity. There are great opportunities out there for JavaScript professionals these days, and it is our mission to provide the training tools necessary to succeed in these positions.

What does it take to become a successful Node.js developer? Well, you need to know JavaScript. And you have to have a solid grip on what it takes to build concurrent applications that run on a single thread at scale. It sounds wild, but both of these goals are obtainable with the right learning plan.

We've created a series of courses on LinkedIn Learning that are designed to get you ready to do the work that is expected of a Node.js developer.

## Node.js Essential Training

The first course in this series focuses on the core modules that are available to you with Node.js. These modules are the building blocks that are used to construct the popular frameworks, libraries, and servers that node js developers use. In this course, you will learn to run modules, handle events, work with the file system, spin up external processes, and begin working with streams.

## Node.js Essential Training: Web Servers, Tests, and Deployment

In the second course in this series, we turn our focus to the web. This class starts off by introducing the core http module which we use to build basic http servers. We then move on to introducing npm, Express, and WebSockets. We are preparing you to get the job done, so testing and deployment are also introduced in this course.

## Advanced Node.js

This course focuses on advanced techniques for asynchronous programming and data streaming in Node.js. This class really takes a look at what it means to work efficiently with single threaded Javascript. We learn how to use asynchronous patterns such as callbacks, promises, and async/await to manage processes and enforce sequential, parallel, and concurrent execution. This course wraps up by taking a deep dive into the stream interface and streaming media. The techniques covered in this corse are essential for accomplishing the day to day tasks of a node developer.

## Advanced Node.js: Scaling Applications

With core programming skills in place, it is time to understand how node applications are deployed at scale. In this course, learn sophisticated programming techniques that can help you scale your Node.js applications. This course covers how to clone, fork, partition data, and decompose your node application into microservices.

## Node.js: Design Patterns

The final course in this series is more academic. Here, we take a look at Object Oriented JavaScript by covering the Gang of Four design patterns. We also take a look at techniques for implementing these patterns in JavaScript without using Object Orientation. Design patterns not only provide powerful solutions to the common problems that we face as programmers, they give us the terminology that is necessary to share our ideas with other developers.

With these five courses, you'll be able to go deep into Node.js and learn where, how, and why to use it for your own projects. Enjoy the journey!
