It's common to hear GraphQL described as a REST killer. Here to slash your REST services, to end your endpoints. But today, let's not focus on conflict. Let's consider where GraphQL and REST share something in common: HTTP requests. 

That's right. If you know how to send HTTP requests, you already have the tools necessary to build a client application that communicates with any GraphQL API. We can get data using any method that sends an HTTP request. Let's build a tiny client by using `fetch`, which will work in the browser:

```javascript
const query = `
  query {
    Lift(id: "panorama") {
      name
      status
    }
  }
`;

const url = "https://snowtooth.moonhighway.com/";

const opts = {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query })
};

fetch(url, opts)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

We'll send the `fetch` request with some options. Then we'll convert the response to JSON. When we log the results to the console, we'll see the following:

**results**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Lift": {
      "name": "Panorama",
      "status": "HOLD"
    }
  }
}
```

You could even display your results on an HTML page by replacing the `console.log` with some simple DOM manipulation:

```javascript
fetch(url, opts)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(
    ({ data }) => `
        <p>
          Favorite Lift: ${data.Lift.name} 
          Status: ${data.Lift.status}
        </p>
  `
  )
  .then(text => (document.body.innerHTML = text))
  .catch(console.error);
```

### Mutations with `fetch`

Whenever we want to change data, we'll use a GraphQL mutation. Our API supports a mutation called `setLiftStatus`. This mutation takes in the `id` of the `Lift` you want to change and the new `status` for that lift. The options for `LiftStatus` are a GraphQL enum, a restricted list of options for a specific field. These options are `OPEN`, `CLOSED`, and `HOLD`. Start by defining the `setLiftStatus` mutation string as a variable:

```javascript
const mutation = `
  mutation {
    setLiftStatus(id: "panorama", status: CLOSED) {
      name
      status
    }
  }
`;
```

Then we want to use the same GraphQL endpoint. We'll adjust the body of the request to include the mutation:

```javascript
var url = "https://snowtooth.moonhighway.com/";

var opts = {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query: mutation })
};

```
Finally, we can send the request and log the results:

```javascript
fetch(url, opts)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

And our results will reflect that the Panorama lift status has indeed been changed by the mutation:

**results**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Lift": {
      "name": "Panorama",
      "status": "CLOSED"
    }
  }
}
```

### graphql-request

There are other frameworks that can be used to send GraphQL operations to an API. One of the most minimal examples of this is `graphql-request`. GraphQL Request wraps `fetch` requests in a promise that can be used to make requests to the GraphQL server. It also handles the details of making the request and parsing the data for you. `graphql-request` is maintained by the team at [Prisma](https://prisma.io).

To get started with `graphql-request`, you will need to install it:

```
npm install graphql-request --save
```

From there, you'll import and use the module as `request`:

```javascript
import { request } from "graphql-request";

const query = `
  query {
    Trail(id: "grandma") {
      name
      status
    }
  }
`;

request("https://snowtooth.moonhighway.com/graphql", query)
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

The request function takes in `url` and `query`, makes the request to the server, and returns the data in one line of code. The data returned is, as expected, a JSON response of all of the users:

```json
{
  "Trail": {
    "name": "Grandma",
    "status": "OPEN"
  }
}
```
Notice that the results here are a little bit different than the `fetch` request. Instead of returning the data under the `data` key, the request sent with `graphql-request` returns just the object. If you wanted to use this data in your app, you would access that data off of the `Trail` key.


Working with GraphQL on the client doesn't require a tremendous amount of setup. Start with one of these options to start seeing the benefits of GraphQL immediately.
