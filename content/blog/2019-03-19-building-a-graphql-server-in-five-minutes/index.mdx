It's 5:55pm on a Friday night. It's your night to cook, and you don't have a recipe. This wouldn't be that big of a deal if you hadn't bragged about the new taco recipe that you were going to cook on Friday night. But you had no recipe. You lied.

You really don't want to be seen as a bragger and a liar. One or the other, fine, but both? It's a bridge too far. You need to find a recipe, and you need to find it now.

You open your computer, and go to Google to find a delicious new taco recipe. But Google is down. WTF? You reach for your phone and see a notification: _"BREAKING: All Search Engines Are Down Across World"_. There's no Google. There's no Bing. There's no AskJeeves. That's unrelated to this, but AskJeeves is still not available.

The only way you're going to be able to handle this situation is to send a query to the [TacoFancy Taco Randomizer API route](https://github.com/evz/tacofancy-api) that you have committed to memory, and the only way that you can do that is to build a GraphQL API. You have to do that by 6:00pm. You have five minutes to build a GraphQL server. The time starts now.

You start by initializing a Node project and installing the dependencies with npm:

```
mkdir taco-emergency
cd taco-emergency
npm init -y
npm install graphql apollo-server
```

Then create a file called `index.js`, and add the following:

```javascript
const { ApolloServer } = require("apollo-server");

const server = new ApolloServer({});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => 
    console.log(`Server running on port ${url}`));
```

You'll require `ApolloServer`, your GraphQL server library of choice, from the `apollo-server` package. Then create a new instance of the `ApolloServer`. Then you'll run it, and it will listen on port 4000.

Any new instance of Apollo Server must take in `typeDefs`, your GraphQL schema, and `resolvers`, the functions that are used to get the data to fulfill the requirements of the schema.

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers
});
```

You'll start with the schema. You need to grab the direct url for a taco recipe. All of the queries available on a GraphQL API are found in the `Query` type:

```javascript
const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    recipeURL: String
  }
`;
```

When you send a query for the `recipeURL`, it should return a value of type `String`.

Next, you create a resolver for this query. The resolver will go get the data you need from the API by using a simple `fetch` call. Start by installing `node-fetch` with npm:

```
npm install node-fetch
```

Add this to your list of require statements at the top of the file too:

```javascript
const fetch = require("node-fetch");
```

Then create the resolvers object. These functions will return the data we need for the `recipeURL`:

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    recipeURL: () => {}
    }
  }
};
```

Think about what you need the `recipeURL` resolver to do. **THINK!** It needs to make a `fetch` call to the Taco API to get a random recipe. Then it needs to transform the data response and just grab the URL out of the response, not all of the extra fields.

Resolvers can be asynchronous, so you use an async function for the `recipeURL`. Within this function, you fetch from the API and log the result to the console:

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    recipeURL: async () => {
      let taco = await fetch(
        "http://taco-randomizer.herokuapp.com/random/"
      ).then(res => res.json());
      console.log(taco);
    }
  }
};
```

Now you run `node index` in the Terminal to run this file. When you open up `localhost:4000`, you see the GraphQL Playground, which will allow you to send GraphQL queries directly in the browser. On the left side, you'll write the query:

```graphql
query {
  recipeURL
}
```

Then we'll click `Play`. The data returned on the right side is the following:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "recipeURL": null
  }
}
```

This is ok, because you're really trying to take a look at the full object logged to the console or Terminal. If you open the terminal, you'll see a blob of data. Remember that this is a random taco, so your result will differ slightly:

```json
{
    base_layer: {
        url: "https://raw.github.com/sinker/tacofancy/master/base_layers/spaghetti_squash.md",
        ...
    }
}
```

Now that you know what the response object looks like you can drill down into it to grab just the URL.

**TICK TOCK TICK TOCK**

You change the resolver to return just the URL string:

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    recipeURL: async () => {
      let taco = await fetch(
        "http://taco-randomizer.herokuapp.com/random/"
      ).then(res => res.json());
      return taco.base_layer.url;
    }
  }
};
```

And you stop and restart the index file: `node index`. You click Play to run the query again:

```graphql
query {
  recipeURL
}
```

**5...4...**

You get the response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "recipeURL": "https://raw.github.com/sinker/tacofancy/master/base_layers/bellpepper.md"
  }
}
```

**3...2...**

Copy and paste the URL into the browser, and you have your recipe. You did it. Dinner is saved. Your integrity is saved. All thanks to a simple GraphQL server.
