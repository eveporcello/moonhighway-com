GraphQL fields can return lists and objects, but of course, they can also return singular values. These are called **scalar types**. A scalar in computer science represents a single variable, an atomic unit that can hold one value at a time. A lot of data for our apps falls into the scalar category: names, email addresses, phone numbers. These are leaves of the tree: lone values instead of objects.

GraphQL has a collection of [default scalar types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types) that you can use as values for any field.

- `Int`: A 32-bit integer
- `Float`: A floating-point value
- `String`: A UTF-8 character sequence
- `Boolean`: `true` or `false`
- `ID`: A unique identifier (serialized as a string)

These scalars are suitable for the majority of situations. When you're designing a schema, you can look at each field and consider: does this field return an object type or a scalar type? If a scalar type is best, you'll typically choose from one of the five built-in scalars.

Let's consider some song data:

```javascript
let songs = [
  {
    id: '3123',
    title: 'Toxic',
    artist: 'Britney Spears',
    topChartPosition: 1,
    numberOne: true,
    releaseDate: '1/13/2004'
  },
  {
    id: '5325',
    title: 'Poison',
    artist: 'Bell Biv Devoe',
    topChartPosition: 3,
    numberOne: false,
    releaseDate: '2/24/1990'
  }
];
```

To represent this data, we'd create a `Song` type:

```graphql
type Song {
  title: String!
}
```

Setting `String` as the type for a song title makes a lot of sense: it's a small blob of text. It doesn't have to be formatted in a certain style. It's just a blob of text.

Then you'd continue that process for all fields in the `Song` object.

```graphql
type Song {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  artist: String!
  topChartPosition: Int
  numberOne: Boolean
  releaseDate: String!
}
```

This type is looking good, but hold on. What about `releaseDate`? That's a date. It has some semantic meaning, and we likely want to save this in a specific format. For that, we can create a custom scalar type.

## Returning Custom Scalars

To create a custom scalar, you'll add a scalar type definition to the schema:

```
scalar Date
```

And set the value of `releaseDate` to `Date`:

```graphql
type Song {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  artist: String!
  topChartPosition: Int
  numberOne: Boolean
  releaseDate: Date!
}
```

Every field in our schema needs to map to a resolver, a function that returns data for a field. The `releaseDate`field needs to map to a resolver for the `Date` type. With `Date`, we will be able to parse and validate any fields that use this scalar as `Date` types.

In the file contains your resolvers, you'll import `GraphQLScalarType`:

```javascript
const { GraphQLScalarType } = require('graphql');
```

Then create a resolver at the root of your resolver object for `Date`:

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    allSongs: () => songs
  },
  Date: new GraphQLScalarType({
    name: 'Date',
    description: 'A formatted date',
    serialize: () => 'a date'
  })
};
```

Within the constructor, you'll add fields for `name`, `description`, and `serialize`.

When we query the `releaseDate` field, the `serialize` function is called. With that function, we can return a whatever we want including a string that says "a date". Or more usefully, we could return a formatted date.

Consider the various ways in which we can represent a date and time as a string. All of these strings represent valid dates:

- "4/19/2021"
- "4/19/2021 1:30:00 PM"
- "Fri Apr 19 2021 12:10:17 GMT-0700 (PDT)"
- "2021-04-19T19:09:57.308Z"

We can use any of these strings to create `datetime` objects with JavaScript:

```javascript
var d = new Date('4/19/2021');
console.log(d.toISOString());
// "2019-04-18T07:00:00.000Z"
```

Now instead of returning a string from the `serialize` function, let's convert the date into an ISO-formatted date string.

```javascript
Date: new GraphQLScalarType({
  name: 'Date',
  description: 'A formatted date',
  serialize: value => new Date(value).toISOString()
});
```

Now when we query the releaseDate field, the serialize function is invoked which converts the string to a Date object, then an ISO string.

The serialize function will be called anytime we query a field. Let's adjust this resolver to handle values that are sent as mutation arguments.

The `addSong` mutation takes the following arguments and returns a `Song`:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  addSong(title: String!, artist: String!, releaseDate: Date!): Song
}
```

In order to parse client input or arguments, we need to add two additional functions to the custom scalar resolver:

```javascript
Date: new GraphQLScalarType({
  name: 'Date',
  description: 'A formatted date',
  serialize: value => value.substring(0, 10),
  parseValue: value => new Date(value).toISOString(),
  parseLiteral: literal => new Date(literal.value).toISOString()
});
```

`parseValue` is called when arguments are passed as variables.

```graphql
mutation($title: String!, $artist: String!, $releaseDate: Date!) {
  addSong(title: $title, artist: $artist, releaseDate: $releaseDate) {
    releaseDate # serialize() is called to return the date
  }
}
```

Query Variables

```json
{
  "title": "Loading Zones",
  "artist": "Kurt Vile",
  "releaseDate": "10/12/2018"
}
```

The value is parsed from the JavaScript object, converted to a `Date` object, then to an ISO string. When we call `serialize` to return the date, we get a substring - just the first 10 characters in YYYY-MM-DD format.

`parseLiteral` is called when arguments are sent inline as strings, not as variables.

```graphql
mutation {
  addSong(
    title: "Loading Zones"
    artist: "Kurt Vile"
    releaseDate: "10/12/2018"
  ) {
    releaseDate # serialize() is called to return the date
  }
}
```

We get the value from the AST, convert to a `Date` object, then to an ISO string. Then `serialize` is invoked the same way for the `releaseDate` field.

Custom scalars provide a way to assign semantic meaning to a field that returns a leaf or single value. If you're looking to save some time, there are npm packages that can help with this including [graphql-scalars](https://github.com/okgrow/graphql-scalars), [graphql-type-json](https://github.com/taion/graphql-type-json), and [graphql-currency-scalars](https://github.com/abhiaiyer91/graphql-currency-scalars).
