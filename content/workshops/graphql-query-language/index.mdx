# The "QL" in GraphQL

GraphQL adoption is increasing every year. Because GraphQL is just a spec, you have lots of different implementations to choose from in a variety of programming languages: JavaScript, Ruby, Python, etc.

However you implement the server, one thing stays the same: the GraphQL query language. It puts the “QL” in GraphQL, and it’s your key to unlocking all the benefits of a GraphQL API.

# The workshop

In this 2 hour workshop with Eve Porcello and Alex Banks, you will learn the ins and outs of the GraphQL query language. You'll get hands-on experience writing, refining, and mutating queries, creating GraphQL unions, and finding ways to maximize the efficiency of the data in your application.

By the end of the workshop, you'll be prepared to query and interact with any existing GraphQL API. 

# Topics we’ll cover:

- Exploring an API with GraphQL Playground
- Writing queries
- Refining queries with filters and variables
- Saving time with GraphQL fragments
- GraphQL unions
- Mutations
- Subscribing to changes
